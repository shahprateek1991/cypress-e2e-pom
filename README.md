# Cypress E2E tests using page object model
The tests run against a sample website from [Cypress](https://example.cypress.io/)

## Commands to run the test suite
Make sure to run `npm install` before running these commands.
* `npm run start` : Runs the test suite in the visual mode (non-headless)
* `npm run startHeadless` : Runs the test suite in headless mode
* `npm run startDebug` :  Starts the Cypress in debug mode.

## Page Object model
This is a popular design pattern (specifically with [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/PageObjects)), which models your application's UI component into objects. It helps in keeping your interaction well encapsulated and helps in reducing the duplication.
